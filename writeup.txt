2 Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer
2.1
a. chr(0) returns '\x00'
b. We need the escape character for the backslash - here is the chr(0).__repr__(): "'\\x00'"
c. Printing chr(0) reveals that it appears to be an empty string

Notes
- any text can be represented as a sequence of integers 0-255

2.2
a. It's useful to use utf8 because it encodes ASCII characters with a single byte whereas utf32 uses 4 bytes for every character and utf16 dedicates 2-4 bytes per character. For other characters, utf16 can be more efficient, but not for common characters.
b. Since utf8 can have variable length (1-4) bytes per character, this incorrectly splits multi-byte characters into multiple characters. Here's a string that fails: "5 รท 2 = 2.5"
c. I understand the concept and won't spend my time looking this up at the moment.
